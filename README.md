# 2D-Plotter
Arduino software for reading G-Code and using it to run a 2D plotter  
The 2D-plotter code file can be used to control a 2D-plotter using an Arduino UNO, without using a CNC shield. 
The only electronic compoenents needed are 2x stepper motors for movement in the X and Y directions, 1x servo motor for moving the pen up and down, 
and an SD card for storing the G-code file.
